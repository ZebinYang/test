Model Diagnostics
=======================

Accuracy: popular metrics like MSE, MAE for regression tasks and ACC, AUC, Recall, Precision, F1-score for binary classification tasks.

Fairness: disparity test and segmented analysis by integrating the solas-ai package.

WeakSpot: identification of weak regions with high residuals by slicing techniques.

Overfit: identification of overfitting regions according to train-test performance gap.

Reliability: assessment of prediction uncertainty by split conformal prediction techniques.

Robustness: evaluation of performance degradation under covariate noise perturbation.

Resilience: evaluation of performance degradation under different out-of-distribution scenarios.
