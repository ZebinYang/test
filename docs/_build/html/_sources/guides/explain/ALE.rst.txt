ALE (Accumulated Local Effects)
=================================

Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) is a model-agnostic global explanation method that evaluates the relationship between feature values and target variables. However, in the event that features are highly correlated, PDP may include unlikely combinations of feature values in the average prediction calculation due to the independent manipulation of feature values across the marginal distribution. This lowers the trust in the PDP explanation when features have a strong correlation. Unlike PDP, ALE handles feature correlations by averaging and accumulating the difference in predictions across the conditional distribution, which isolates the effects of the specific feature. This comes at the cost of requiring a larger number of observations and a near uniform distribution of those observations so that the conditional distribution can be reliably determined.
